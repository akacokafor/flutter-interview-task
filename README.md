# Flutter Interview Task

## Interview Task

Build the Patient Referral Form using this [design spec](https://www.figma.com/file/bSQMB5hImn2F44fmsr9559/Flutter-Interview-Task?node-id=0%3A1).

There is no need to build any backend (api layer, server, database). For simulating form submission, you can do a POST to https://hookb.in/mZZ8pmBdk6ilzXNNzQGp

- On the Dashboard, we expect that the rows scroll horizontally

## Duration

Up to 8 hours. We do not expect you to complete the assessment in this time.

## Submission
1.  Fork this repo
2.  Build The UI using Flutter.
3.  Implement an integration test to verify that on register, the dashboard is shown
4.  Make sure to use an project architecture that clearly separates concerns
5.  Write Unit tests and Widget tests to verify that widgets work as you intend.
6.  Submit a Pull Request (PR)
7.  In the PR, include a README that includes the following:
    -  If you made any assumptions, what are they
    - Outline what else needs to be done if given more time
